# NC News Front End

Try out the hosted app here: [https://dw-nc-news.netlify.app/](https://dw-nc-news.netlify.app/)

## What is it?

This app was made during a skills bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)

This app is the front end which connects with an express API, that I made for the back end: https://github.com/duncan-s-white/news-api

It is a React app using the Material UI Library.

The app design is mobile first, so views best on mobile devices, although it should work on almost any size of device.

## Setup locally

### Clone:

`git clone https://github.com/duncan-s-white/fe-nc-news.git`
